## Architecture Patterns
### 1. MVVM
- **MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)** is an architecture pattern that separates the user interface (`View`) from the business logic and data (`Model`) through an intermediary component called the `ViewModel`
- **Components:**
    - **Model**: responsible for managing and abstracting data sources (databases, APIs, ..). 
    `Model` and `ViewModel` work together to get and save the data.
    - **View**: displays data provided by the `ViewModel` and informs the `ViewModel` about user actions. This layer observes the `ViewModel` and does not contain application logic.
    - **ViewModel**: exposes data and state that are relevant to the `View`, and transforms data from Model into a suitable format. Moreover, it serves as a link between the `Model` and the `View`.
    - **Binder** (Data Binding): connects the View and the ViewModel, automatically synchronizing data between them. This mechanism allows the View to update when the `ViewModel` changes, and vice versa.

- **Workflow:**
    1. User interacts with the `View` (e.g., clicks a button).
    2. The `View` notifies the `ViewModel`.
    3. The `ViewModel` processes the input, applies logic, and may request data from the `Model`.
    4. The `Model` fetches or updates the data (e.g., from an API or database).
    5. The `Model` sends data back to the `ViewModel`.
    6. The `ViewModel` updates the observable data, which automatically updates the `View` through `data binding or observers`.
```bash
User
 ↓
View ↔ ViewModel ↔ Model    # view automatically update
       (data binding)
```
### 2. MVC
![Diagram](../../docs/uml/ap/ap_mvc_example.drawio.svg)
- **MVC (Model - View - Controller)** is an architectural pattern that separates the user interface (`View`) from the application logic and data (`Model`) using an intermediary component called the `Controller`.
- **Components:**
    - **Model**: is responsible for managing and abstracting data sources (databases, APIs, etc.). The `Model` handles data retrieval, storage, and business logic.
    - **View**: displays the data provided by the `Model` and represents the user interface. The `View` is responsible only for presentation and `does not contain business logic`.
    - **Controller**: acts as an intermediary between the `View` and the `Model`. It receives user input from the `View`, processes it, and interacts with the `Model` to update or retrieve data. The `Controller` then determines which `View` should display the result.

- **Workflow:**
    1. User interacts with the `View` (e.g., clicks a button).
    2. The `View` sends the user input to the `Controller`.
    3. The `Controller` processes the input, performs business logic, and may update the `Model`.
    4. The `Model` updates its data (e.g., saves to a database or gets data from an API).
    5. The `Controller` then updates the `View` based on the new `Model` data.
```bash
User
 ↓
View → Controller → Model
            ↓
           View # view update manually
```
### 3. GTK4

### 4. Trade-offs: MVC vs MVVM

| Aspect               | MVC                                                                 | MVVM                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**      | Lower — **Controller** is a thin pass-through                           | Slightly higher — **ViewModel** adds an extra layer                     |
| **Coupling**        | Views know both **Controller** and **Model** (e.g., for initial data)       | **Views** know only the **ViewModel**                                       |
| **Testability**     | Controller is testable, but **Views** are still tied to **Model** for reads | **ViewModel** is fully testable without GTK; Views are pure UI          |
| **Scalability**     | Adding fields requires updating **Model**, **Controller**, and all **Views**    | Adding fields requires updating **Model** and **ViewModel**; Views update bindings only |
| **Observer wiring** | Manual — Container wires each **View** to the **Model**                     | Self-contained — **Views** register via **ViewModel**; container stays clean|
| **UI logic leakage**| Risk - Views may call `model_->getData()` directly                  | Eliminated - Views use `viewModel_->getCurrentText()` only          |
