# Date and Time
- <ctime> : provides functions and types to work with date and time values including parsing and formatting (inherited from C)

- <chrono>: provides facilities to deal with the duration time points and clocks (std11), it is more modern and type-safe approach

## ctime
- Data Types:
  - `time_t`: for timestamps
  - `struct tm`: for datetime structes 
  - Use `mktime()` to convert struct tm to time_t, and `localtime()` and `gmtime()` for vice versa
- `strftime()` format:
